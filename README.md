## Footnotes

### Curation Policy

This list is a curation, not a collection. Every entry must clear these gates:

**Accepted:**

* Tools, modules, or resources directly usable in Terraform or OpenTofu workflows
* Actively maintained (meaningful activity within 12 months; open-source projects need 20+ GitHub stars, with rare exceptions for tools that fill a clear gap)
* Solves a specific compliance, security, governance, or evidence problem at the IaC layer
* Framework references must map controls to Terraform-implementable resources, not just describe the framework

**Not accepted:**

* Kubernetes-only policy tools with no Terraform integration path
* Generic cloud security or GRC platforms without a Terraform/IaC-specific integration
* Vendor blog posts or product documentation pages (learning resources must be genuinely educational, not marketing)
* Deprecated, archived, sunset, unmaintained, or abandoned projects (rejected outright, not marked or kept)
* Duplicate entries covering the same tool from different angles
* Tools available only in a cloud provider console with no Terraform resource or provider support
